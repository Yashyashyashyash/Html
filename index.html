  <br>
  <p style="font-size:30px;font-family:times new roman;"><b>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</b> is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.<br>During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus", with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia<br>The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020. Tedros Adhanom explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for 2019 (the year in which the outbreak was first identified). <br>The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
  <br>
  Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache,fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.<br> Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.<br> Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).<br> Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms.<br> Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.
<br>
COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors.<br> Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms.
<br>
Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease.<br> The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab.<br>

Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries, which have initiated mass vaccination campaigns.<br> Other preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.<br> The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimize the risk of transmissions.<br> While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.

  <summary style="font-family: times new roman;font-size:50px;color:blue;"><h2><i><u>SYMPTOMS</u></i></h2></summary>
  <br>
  <p style="font-size:30px;font-family: times new roman;">Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.Common symptoms include headache, loss of smell and taste, nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever, diarrhea, and breathing difficulties.<br> People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time.<br> Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. <br>In people without prior ear, nose, and throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19 and is reported in as many as 88% of cases.<br>

Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) and 5% of patients suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).<br> At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.<br> These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can spread the disease.<br> Other infected people will develop symptoms later, called "pre-symptomatic", or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.<br>

 As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms.<br> The median delay for COVID-19 is four to five days. Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.<br>

Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease.<br> However, some people – over half of a cohort of home-isolated young adults– continue to experience a range of effects, such as fatigue, for months after recovery, a condition called long COVID; long-term damage to organs has been observed. <br>Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.</p>

<summary style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:50px;color:blue;"><h2><i><u>TRANSMISSION</u></i></h2></summary>
<br>
<p style="font-size:30px;font-family:times new roman;">COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors.<br> Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces.<br> People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms.<br>Infectious particles range in size from aerosols that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time to larger droplets that remain airborne or fall to the ground.<br>Additionally, COVID-19 research has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses are transmitted.<br> The largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far, and can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or mouth to infect.<br> Aerosols are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity, which leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close,but airborne transmission can occur at longer distances, mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated; in those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.
<br>
The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies; as only 10 to 20% of people are responsible for the disease's spread.<br>It often spreads in clusters, where infections can be traced back to an index case or geographical location.<br>Often in these instances, superspreading events occur, where many people are infected by one person.<br>
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains.<br> It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).<br> The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane 
<br> (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV.<br> The structure of the M protein resembles the sugar transporter SemiSWEET.<br>
Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged throughout 2020.Cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark.<br>After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark as of 1 February 2021.<br>

As of July 2021, there are four dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2 spreading among global populations: the Alpha Variant (formerly called the UK Variant and officially referred to as B.1.1.7), first found in London and Kent, the Beta Variant (formerly called the South Africa Variant and officially referred to as B.1.351), the Gamma Variant (formerly called the Brazil Variant and officially referred to as P.1), and the Delta Variant (formerly called the India Variant and officially referred to as B.1.617.2).

 <summary style="font-family: times new roman;font-size:50px;color: blue;"><h2><i><u>DIAGNOSIS</u></i></h2></summary>
 <br>
 <p style="font-size:30px;font-family: times new roman;">COVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions.<br> Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infections.<br> Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection.<br>The standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its "ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited." <br>The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.<br> Results are generally available within hours.The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
<br>
Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. <br>Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.
<br>
The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence that "a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with" and have called for "an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing".<br> On 7 September, the UK government issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results".</p>

 <summary style="font-family: times new roman;font-size:50px;color:blue;"><h2><i><u>PREVENTION</u></i></h2></summary>
 <p style="font-size:30px;font-family: times new roman;">Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.<br>A <b><u>COVID‑19 vaccine</u></b> is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19).<br> Prior to the COVID‑19 pandemic, an established body of knowledge existed about the structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).<br> This knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine platforms during early 2020.<br> The initial focus of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was on preventing symptomatic, often severe illness.<br> On 10 January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID, and by 19 March, the global pharmaceutical industry announced a major commitment to address COVID‑19.<br> The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19.
<br>
Many countries have implemented phased distribution plans that prioritize those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.
<br>
As of 1 December 2021, 8.03 billion doses of COVID‑19 vaccines have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national public health agencies.<br> By December 2020, more than 10 billion vaccine doses had been preordered by countries, with about half of the doses purchased by high-income countries comprising 14% of the world's population.

<br>
<br>
The WHO and the US CDC recommend individuals wear <b><u> non-medical face coverings</u></b> in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.<br> This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.<br> Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.<br> A face covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air, reducing the chances of infection.<br> But, if the mask include an exhalation valve, a wearer that is infected (maybe without having noticed that, and asymptomatic) would transmit the virus outwards through it, despite any certification they can have.<br> So the masks with exhalation valve are not for the infected wearers, and are not reliable to stop the pandemic in a large scale.<br> Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.
<br>
Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.<br> When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available. <br>Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.<br> Healthcare professionals interacting directly with people who have COVID-19 are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent, in addition to other personal protective equipment.<br>

style="width:1000px;height:900px;">
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Social distancing</u></b> (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals.<br> Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. <br>Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.<br> Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.<br>

Outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.<br> In the United States, the prisoner population is aging and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID-19 due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality healthcare.

style="width:1000px;height:900px;">
<br>
<br>
Thorough <b><u>hand hygiene</u></b> after any cough or sneeze is required.<br> The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose.<br>When soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol.<br>For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.<br> In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.<br> Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis." Glycerol is added as a humectant.<br>

 <summary style="font-family: times new roman;font-size:50px;color:blue;"><h2><i><u>TREATMENT</u></i></h2></summary>
 <p style="font-size:30px;font-family: times new roman;">There is no specific, effective treatment or cure for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<br> One year into the pandemic, highly effective vaccines have now been introduced and are beginning to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2; however, for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination, treatment remains important.<br> Thus, the lack of progress developing effective treatments means that the cornerstone of management of COVID-19 has been supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support and prone positioning as needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.<br>

Most cases of COVID-19 are mild. In these, supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDs to relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids, rest, and nasal breathing.<br>Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended.<br> The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask.<br>

People with more severe cases may need treatment in hospital. <br>In those with low oxygen levels, use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone is strongly recommended, as it can reduce the risk of death.<br> Noninvasive ventilation and, ultimately, admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing.<br> Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.<br> Some of the cases of severe disease course are caused by systemic hyper-inflammation, the so called cytokine storm.<br>

Several experimental treatments are being actively studied in clinical trials.<br> These include fluvoxamine, a cheap and widely available antidepressant; and the antivirals molnupiravir (developed by Merck),<br> and PF-07321332 (developed by Pfizer).<br> Others were thought to be promising early in the pandemic, such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, but later research found them to be ineffective or even harmful.<br> Despite ongoing research, there is still not enough high-quality evidence to recommend so-called early treatment.<br> Nevertheless, in the United States, two monoclonal antibody-based therapies are available for early use in cases thought to be at high risk of progression to severe disease.<br> The antiviral remdesivir is available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and several other countries, with varying restrictions; however, it is not recommended for people needing mechanical ventilation, and is discouraged altogether by the World Health Organization (WHO).<br> In November 2021, the UK approved the use of Molnupiravir as a Covid treatment for vulnerable patients recently diagnosed with the disease.<br>
